## Introduction

This mod adds a couple things on *top* of the other [BlackBlock.rocks](https://blackblock.rocks) mods.
It depends entirely on the other mods, and does not supply much of anything on its own.

## PolyMC & Vanilla clients

These custom blocks & items do not require a modded client, anyone can join thanks to PolyMC.
